Hello all. This is my personal config for zsh and bash. Its very small.

I have made very few tweaks, mostly just minor formatting changes on the one or two themes that I use on each.

You can email me at nevetsepirc21@gmail.com, if it turns out I messed up and somehow there's an error.

Since this repo uses submodules, cloning is best achieved with the '--recursive' flag.
